Colonists with Inspired Taming can tame animals beyond their current skill level.

In the mod options you can:
    - totally ignore minimum skill requirements for inspired taming, or
    - give the inspired colonist an temporary adjustable skill level boost for inspired taming.
    
This does not change a colonist's actual Animals skill level.

[h1]Compatibility[/h1]
- No known incompatibilities.

[h1]Notes[/h1]
- Is perfectly safe to add or remove at any time from your save.
- Can be placed anywhere in the mod list after Harmony.
- Doesn't add or remove anything - it just adds an extra allowance for inspired taming to CanInteractWithAnimal.
- Please feel free to make technical suggestions or otherwise critique the code.

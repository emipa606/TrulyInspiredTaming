# Truly Inspired Taming
A RimWorld mod:

Colonists with Inspired Taming can tame animals beyond their current skill level.

In the mod options you can:
    - totally ignore minimum skill requirements for inspired taming, or
    - give the inspired colonist an temporary adjustable skill level boost for inspired taming.
    
This does not change a colonist's actual Animals skill level.

### Compatibility
- Compatible with RimWorld **v1.1** and the **Royalty** DLC.
- No known incompatibilities.

### Notes
- Is perfectly safe to add or remove at any time from your save.
- Can be placed anywhere in the mod list after Harmony.
- Doesn't add or remove anything - it just adds an extra allowance for inspired taming to CanInteractWithAnimal.
- Please feel free to make technical suggestions or otherwise critique the code.

### How to use
